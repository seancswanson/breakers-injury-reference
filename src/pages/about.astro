          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>The Breaker's Injury Reference is an open-source project dedicated to helping breakdancers understand and prevent common injuries. Our mission is to provide accessible, visual information about the anatomical stress points in various breaking moves, potential injuries, and prevention strategies.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
          <h2>What We Offer</h2>
          <ul class="list-disc">
            <li>Basic 3D models highlighting stress points for common breaking moves</li>
              <li>Fundamental anatomy guides relevant to breakdancing</li>
              <li>General training tips for injury prevention</li>
              <li>Community forum for discussion and sharing experiences</li>
          </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
          <h2>How It Works</h2>
          <p>We use a specialized AI prompt to generate initial data for each breaking move. This data includes:</p>
          <ol class="list-disc">
            <li>Areas to highlight on a 3D human model (muscles, joints, etc.)</li>
              <li>Potential injuries associated with each highlighted area</li>
              <li>Causes and simple remedies for each potential injury</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This AI-generated data serves as a starting point for our content. In future iterations, all information will be refined and verified by medical experts and experienced breakers to ensure accuracy and relevance.</p>
