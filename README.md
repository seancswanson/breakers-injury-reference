# The Breaker's Injury Reference

## Project Overview

The Breaker's Injury Reference is an open-source website dedicated to helping breakdancers understand and prevent common injuries. Our goal is to provide accessible, visual information about the anatomical stress points in various breaking moves, potential injuries, and prevention strategies.

## Current Status

This project is in early development. We are currently using AI-assisted content generation to create our initial database of moves, associated anatomical stress points, and injury information. All content will require expert review and validation in future iterations.

## Features (Beta Version)

- Basic 3D models highlighting stress points for common breaking moves
- Fundamental anatomy guides relevant to breakdancing
- General training tips for injury prevention
- Community forum for discussion and sharing experiences

## How It Works

We use a specialized AI prompt to generate initial data for each breaking move. The prompt provides:

1. Areas to highlight on a 3D human model (muscles, joints, etc.)
2. Potential injuries associated with each highlighted area
3. Causes and simple remedies for each potential injury

This data serves as a starting point for our content, which will be refined and verified by experts in future versions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/breakers-injury-reference.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd breakers-injury-reference`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` (or equivalent for your chosen stack)
4. Run the development server: `npm start`

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

- 3D modeling and animation
